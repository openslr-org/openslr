	        <p><h3 class="slrStyle"> About OpenSLR </h3>
              OpenSLR is a site devoted to hosting speech and language resources, such as training
              corpora for speech recognition, and software related to speech recognition.  We intend to be a convenient place for anyone to
              put resources that they have created, so that they can be downloaded publicly.
            <p>
              Part of our goal is to mirror software available elsewhere, in order to provide a
              failover location.  We are starting by mirroring some software which is used
              in the <a href="https://kaldi-asr.org"> Kaldi </a> scripts.
            <p>
              We aim to provide a central, hassle-free place for others to put their speech resources.
              For more information, see <a href=/contributions.html> here </a>.
	    <p>
	      If you wanna keep updated, we have created a mailing list 
	      <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openslr-news"><texttt>openslr-news@googlegroups.com</texttt></a> 
	      in which we intend to send announcements about newest additions and other news.
            <p>
              For a list of resources, please click on <a href="resources.php" target="_top"> resources </a> above.
            <p>
             If you want to download things from this site, please download them one at a time, and please don't use
             any fancy software-- just download things from your browser or use 'wget'.
             We have a firewall rule to drop connections from hosts with more than 5 simultaneous connections, and certain
	     types of download software may activate this rule.
	    <p>
	     Now, aside from the main site
	     <a href=https://openslr.org>openslr.org</a>, we also have a mirror in
	     China that is available at <a href=https://openslr.magicdatatech.com>openslr.magicdatatech.com</a>.
	     The mirror server is made available by <a href=https://www.magicdatatech.com/>Magic Data Technology.</a>.
	     Thank you Magic Data Technology!
	     <br>
	     Another mirror of the content is provided by <a href="http://www.elda.org/en/" >ELDA</a> in EU. The server is available as
	     <a href="https://openslr.elda.org">openslr.elda.org</a>. Thank you ELDA!
