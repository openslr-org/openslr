Audiocite.net is a corpus of read French speech downloaded in November 2021 from the <a href="https://www.audiocite.net/">Audiocite.net website</a>.
<br>
With a total duration of 6682 hours of audio recording, this corpus is the result of the voluntary work of 130 speakers.
The metadata is divided into 4 .jsons files (all(100%), train(80%), dev(10%) and test(10%)) to be used in NLP models.
<br>
The corpus and its metadata were uploaded through a script distributing the information in a .csv file. The use of these audio and metadata files is intended for pre-trained speech models.
