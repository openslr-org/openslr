<p>This dataset is part of our effort to increase the amount of data available for low-resource languages like Armenian
    and Georgian. <br> It consists of processed audiobooks, which initially consisted of single big transcript and tens
    of minutes long audios for each chapter. <br> To make the data ASR/TTS friendly we converted the raw corpus and many
    multi second long audio chunks (typically 3-15seconds) with corresponding texts.</p>

<p> We coordinated with the original authors from Grqaser.org, who agreed on the selection of new books we processed.
    <br>
    To make the reconstruction of the books (usually different speakers per book) harder, we encoded the names of audios
    <br>
    and hide book, chapter and author information. This is done to avoid Voice Cloning attempts on TTS setup (as the
    <br>
    majority of the data were collected on voluntary bases and cloning the voices of those people is forbidden).
</p>

<p>The .tgz file contains the following directories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>texts/</code> - Contains text transcripts in .txt format</li>
  <li><code>audios/</code> - Contains audio files in .wav format</li>
</ul>
