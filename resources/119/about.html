The AliMeeting Mandarin corpus, originally designed for ICASSP 2022 Multi-channel Multi-party Meeting Transcription Challenge (M2MeT),  is recorded from real meetings, including far-field speech collected by an 8-channel microphone array as well as near-field speech collected by each participants' headset microphone. The dataset contains 118.75 hours of speech data in total, divided into 104.75 hours for training (Train), 4 hours for evaluation (Eval) and 10 hours as test set (Test), according to M2MeT challenge arrangement. Specifically, the Train, Eval and Test sets contain 212, 8 and 20 meeting sessions respectively, and each session consists of a 15 to 30-minute discussion by 2-4 participants. AliMeeting covers a variety of aspects in real-world meetings, including diverse meeting rooms, various number of meeting participants and different speaker overlap ratios. High-quality transcriptions are provided as well. The dataset can be used for tasks in meeting rich transcriptions, including speaker diarization and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition.
