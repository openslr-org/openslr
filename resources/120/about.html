The HI-MIA-CW is a supplemental database to the HI-MIA wakeup database,
and we used the same setup of HI-MIA database to further record 16434 audios.
<p>

The specific text of the audios is the HI-MIA confusion words in Chinese,
which are the negative samples for wake-up words "hi, Mia" (ni hao mi ya). 
The text details can be found in the paper and the transcription file in resources. 
Each audio sample was recorded in real home environment using high fidelity 
microphone ( 48kHz,16-bit ). Then we re-sampled to 16kHz to build the database.
It contains 35 speakers. There is no overlap between these 35 speakers and the 
speakers who are in the previous HI-MIA database. This dataset aims to promote
the advanced research on wakeup words detection. It serves as negative samples
for the wakeup words detection system. It helps researchers test the performance
when encountering the confusing words.
