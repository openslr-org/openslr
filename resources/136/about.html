  Emotive Narrative Storytelling (EMNS) corpus introduces a
  dataset consisting of a single speaker, British English speech
  with high-quality labelled utterances tailored to drive interactive 
  experiences with dynamic and expressive language. Each audio-text 
  pairs are reviewed for artefacts and quality. Furthermore, 
  we extract critical features using natural language
  descriptions, including word emphasis, level of expressiveness
  and emotion.
