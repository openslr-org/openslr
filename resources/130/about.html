This release of data from the Samrómur collection contains focuses on users where
Icelandic is not their native tongue. The data is mostly UNVERIFIED.
It contains 143,031 (151.8 hours) speech-recordings in Icelandic, of
which 4,957 have been verified. 42,000 utterances have been scored with
marosijo which indicates if it is likely to be valid or not.

<p>
  The corpus is a result of the crowd-sourcing effort run by the Language and
  Voice Lab (LVL) at Reykjavik University, in cooperation with Almannarómur, the
  Icelandic Center for Language Technology. The recording process has started in
  October 2019 and ended September 2022. The present edition of the corpus has
  been authorized for release in September 2022. The aim is to create an
  open-source speech corpus to enable research and development for Icelandic
  Language Technology. The corpus consists of audio recordings and a metadata
  file containing the prompts read by the participants.
</p>
<p>
  Participants are from 6 and up to 80+ years. The distributed audio files are
  encoded at 16 kHz sampling rate, 16 bit linear PCM, 1 channel, *.flac format.
  The corpus is split into train, dev and test subsets. Lengths of the sets are:
  train = 91.4h, test = 29.3h, dev = 31.1h. For more such subsets please use
  ones from the other Samrómur releases. All demographics are self reported. The
  dataset contains folders that correspond to speaker IDs, and the audio files
  inside use the following naming convention: {speaker_ID}-{utterance_ID}.flac.
