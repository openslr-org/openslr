LibriTTS-R [1] is a sound quality improved version of the <a href="http://www.openslr.org/60">LibriTTS corpus (http://www.openslr.org/60/)</a> which is a multi-speaker English corpus of approximately 585 hours of read English speech at 24kHz sampling rate, published in 2019. The constituent samples of LibriTTS-R are identical to those of LibriTTS, with only the sound quality improved. To improve sound quality, a speech restoration model, Miipher proposed by Yuma Koizumi [2], was used.
