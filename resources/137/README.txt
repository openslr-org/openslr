Silbo Gomero Speech Corpus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a corpus of the Silbo Gomero whistled language, which is a whistled
form of Spanish used on the La Gomera island. It was created from 49 minutes of 
raw recordings. The recordings contained read speech, and were produced by 4 fluent 
whistlers. They were created for use in teaching this language to children native 
to the island, and can be assumed to represent expert use of it.

The corpus consists of 3 parts, each of which was made from the same data,
edited in different ways; separate transcription file is provided for each part.
  - words.zip contains clips of single, separate words. Some clips may contain
    more than one word, in cases where the separation was not possible.
  - sentences.zip contains clips of entire sentences. Some parts of the
    recordings are not represented here; for example, one recording contained
    a poem, which could not be separated into sentences.
  - fragments.zip contains clips of short fragments of speech (on average, about
    6.5 words long); those fragments were made by separating recordings where
    longer pauses between words occured.
