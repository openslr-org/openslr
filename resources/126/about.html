The corpus is split as train and test and each folder contains two subfolders named audio_files and trans_files. The folder "audio_files" contains .wav file recordings (16 KhZ, 16 bit, mono, PCM format). The folder "trans_files" contains .txt files in UTF-8 Unicode text corresponding to each audio file.
