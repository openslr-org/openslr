  Pairs of Korean speakers reading scripts with <b>3 distinct text sentiments (negative, neutral, positive)</b>, with <b>3 distinct vocal sentiments (negative, neutral, positive)</b>, are recorded.<br>The recordings took place in <b>3 different types of places</b>, which are an anechoic chamber, studio apartment, and dance studio, of which the level of reverberation differs.<br>And, in order to examine the effect of the distance of mic from the source and device, every experiment is recorded at <b>3 distinct distances</b> with <b>2 types of smartphone</b>, iPhone X, and Galaxy S7.

The dataset is a subset(approximately 1%) of a much bigger dataset 
which were recorded under the same environment as this public dataset. <br>
This sample dataset only contains only a limited amount which contains a single pair of speaker recorded in 3 places, but only at single distance and with iPhone X.<br>
