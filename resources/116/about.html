This release of data from the Samrómur collection focuses on queries. It
contains 17,475 (20 hours) validated speech-recordings in Icelandic.

<p>
  The corpus is a result of the crowd-sourcing effort run by the Language and
  Voice Lab (LVL) at Reykjavik University, in cooperation with Almannarómur, the
  Icelandic Center for Language Technology. The recording process has started in
  October 2019 and continues to this day (December 2021). The present edition of
  the corpus has been authorized for release in December 2021. The aim is to
  create an open-source speech corpus to enable research and development for
  Icelandic Language Technology. The corpus consists of audio recordings and a
  metadata file containing the sentences read by the participants.
</p>
<p>
  Participants are from 6 and up to 80+ years. The distributed audio files are
  encoded at 16 kHz sampling rate, 16 bit linear PCM, 1 channel, *.flac format.
  The corpus is split into train, dev, and test subsets with no speaker overlap.
  Each subset contains folders that correspond to speaker IDs, and the audio
  files inside use the following naming convention:
  {speaker_ID}-{utterance_ID}.flac.
