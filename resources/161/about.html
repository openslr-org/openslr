<b>Emozionalmente</b> is an extensive simulated emotional speech corpus in Italian. 
The dataset comprises 6,902 labeled samples acted out by 431 amateur actors, 
verbalizing 18 different sentences to express the Big Six emotions 
(anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) plus neutrality. 
The labels represent the emotional communicative intention of the actors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Recording specifications:</b> The recordings were generally obtained with 
non-professional equipment. Files are in WAV format, mono-channel, 
16-bit, 16 kHz. Each recording lasts on average 3.81 seconds (SD = 0.99).
</p>

<p>
<b>Validation:</b> To validate the emotional content, 829 human raters 
evaluated each audio clip, providing five ratings per sample. 
The overall Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) achieved by evaluators was 66%, 
comparable to prior studies in the field.
