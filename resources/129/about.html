<strong>BibleTTS</strong> is a large high-quality open Text-to-Speech dataset with up to 80 hours of single speaker, studio quality 48kHz recordings for each language. We release aligned speech and text for six languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa, with unaligned data for four additional languages, derived from the Biblica <a href="https://open.bible/">open.bible</a> project. The data is released under a commercial-friendly <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> license.

<p>
  This repository contains the data for the six aligned languages of the BibleTTS corpus (Asante Twi, Akuapem Twi, Ewe, Hausa, Lingala, Yoruba). <br/>
  This data has been automatically verse-aligned and filtered for TTS training. <br/>
  Each <code>.tgz</code> file contains: speech files for individual verses and corresponding transcripts for each standardized split per language (train, dev, test). Files in each split are grouped into subdirectories by book. <br/>
  The speech data is distributed as flac files in the original 48kHz mono format; it may be desired to resample for TTS training. <br/>
