Substantive material of Yoloxóchitl Mixtec (Glottocode: yolo1241 | ISO 639-3 = xty) presented here was brought together over a period of just over 10 years by Jonathan D. Amith (PI) and Rey Castillo García a native speaker linguist from the community of Yoloxóchitl. Yolóxochitl Mixtec is spoken in four communities: Yoloxóchitl (16.83425, -98.65281), Arroyo Cumiapa (16.87529, -98.61537), Cuanacaxtitlán (16.79992, -98.63940), and Buena Vista (16.96232, -98.58078). It is one of 52 Mixtec languages as designated by Glottocode and is particularly noteworthy for its high number of lexical tones on morae as the tone bearing unit (9 basic tones: four level tones from low [1] to high [4]; and 5 basic contour tones [13, 14, 43, 42, 32]). There are other uncommon lexical tones and inflectional morphology creates additional patterns. The greatest number of contrasts documented is 21 for the segmental sequence nama (which has a total of 24 words that vary only in tone).
