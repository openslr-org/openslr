A crowdsourced open-source speech corpus for the Kazakh language. The KSC contains around 332 hours
of transcribed audio comprising over 153,000 utterances spoken by participants from different
regions and age groups, as well as both genders. It was carefully inspected by native Kazakh
speakers to ensure high quality. The dataset is primarily intended to be used for training
automatic speech recognition systems.
